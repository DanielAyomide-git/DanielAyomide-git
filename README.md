👋 Hi, I’m @DanielAyomide-git

🔍 I’m passionate about software development and artificial intelligence, with a focus on Python, Java, Node.js frameworks (such as Angular and React.js), and PostgreSQL for app development and AI solutions.

📚 I’m currently expanding my knowledge in Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence.

💡 I’m contributing to the development of a cancer detection AI, which I aim to evolve into a more advanced open-source healthcare solution.

📬 Interested in collaborating? Feel free to reach out to me at lanredaniel377@gmail.com.
